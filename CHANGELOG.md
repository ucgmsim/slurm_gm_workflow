### Changed
    - Improved submit and mgmt queue logging

### Changed
    Changes to automated workflow:
    - Split into two processes:
        - Auto-submit: which submits job to the HPC & populates the mgmt db queue with
        updates for the mgmt db
        - Queue monitor: Updates the status of the tasks in mgmt db
    
    For how to use, see the updated [README](https://github.com/ucgmsim/slurm_gm_workflow/blob/master/README.md)
    
    Note: The auto-submit reads from the mgmt db, but NEVER writes or updates

## [19.4.1] - 2019-04-09 -- Initial Version
### Changed
    Changes to autosubmit:
    - Machine queues are maintained individually
    - The desired maximum length for all or each machine queue can be set with the -n flag
