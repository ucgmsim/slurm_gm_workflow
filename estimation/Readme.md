#### Notes
- All of the estimation code is written in python3, the only exception is the 
write_jsons.py script used for metadata collection

### Usage
Estimation is done using the functions inside estimate_wct.py, which use fomulas based on regression data.  
  

Estimation of wall clock is already included in the 
slurm script creation for simulation  
  
For one off estimation the *est_LF_chours_single*, *est_HF_chours_single*, *est_BB_chours_single* 
and *est_IM_chours_single* functions from estimate_WC.py can be used  
```
import estimation.estimate_wct as est
print(est.est_LF_chours_single(nx, ny, nz, nt, fd_count , n_cores))
```

The signatures for the estimation functions are:

```
def est_LF_chours_single(
    nx: int,
    ny: int,
    nz: int,
    nt: int,
    fd_count, int,
    n_cores: int,
):
        pass
        
def est_HF_chours_single(
    fd_count: int,
    nsub_stoch: float,
    nt: int,
    n_cores: int,
):
        pass
        
def est_BB_chours_single(
    fd_count: int,
    nt: int,
    n_cores: int,
):
        pass

def est_IM_chours_single(
    fd_count: int,
    nt: int,
    comp: List[str],
    pSA_count: int,
    n_cores: int,
):
    pass
```

These all return the number of estimated core hours and run time (core house/number of cores), 
to convert that to the wall clock time format use the *convert_to_wct* function. 
To convert and add some extra buffer, use the *get_wct* function.

```
def convert_to_wct(run_time):
    pass
    
def get_wct(run_time, overestimate_factor=0.1):
    pass
``` 


### Creating a pre-trained model
Building a pre-trained model consists of a two main steps, 
**collect and format the data** and then **training the neural network**

#### Colleting the metadata
1) To create the metadata files for a given Run, use the *write_jsons.py* (with the -sj flag) script,
which will create a folder names "jsons" in each fault simulation folder. This jsons folder
then contains a "all_sims.json" file, which has all the metadata for the faults realisations runs.
E.g.
```
python3 write_jsons.py -sj --n_procs 4 /nesi/nobackup/nesi00213/RunFolder/Cybershake/v18p6_batched/v18p6_exclude_1k_batch_2/Runs/
```

2) Combine all the "all_sims.json" files using the *agg_json_data.py* script, which for a given run
folder will find all the metadata json files and combine them into a single dataframe. In addition
it also tidies up some columns, and attempts to convert them all to floats. If entries are missing 
then these are either filled with np.nan for numerical columns or None.
The resulting dataframe is then saved as a .csv file
E.g.
```
python3 agg_json_data.py --n_procs 4 /nesi/nobackup/nesi00213/RunFolder/Cybershake/v18p6/Runs/ /home/cbs51/code/tmp/output.csv
```

It is worth noting that loading that .csv into a dataframe requires some changes from the default arguments
for pd.from_csv due to the multi level columns used in the dataframe.
Loading the resulting csv:
```
import pandas as pd
input_file = "/home/cbs51/code/slurm_gm_workflow/estimation/" \
             "labelled_data/test/kupe_agg_data.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(input_file, index_col=[0], header=[0, 1])
```

3) Steps 1 and 2 can be repeated for as many run folders as wanted. I would suggest putting all the resulting 
.csv files into a single directory, for easier loading when training the neural network model.

#### Training the model

The training of the different models (LF, HF, BB) is done using the *train_model.py* script, which takes a
**config file** and the input data (either as directory or single input files). E.g.
```
./train_model.py --config ./configs/nn_model_config_IM.json -i ./labelled_data/latest_data/cybershake_v18p6_rerun.csv -od ./models/IM/ --show_loss -v
```

The input data is the saved dataframes from the previous step.   
The config file determines the architecture of the neural network, i.e. the columns used for training, target column, number of layers and units, activation function and dropout. 
It also specifies how to train the model, i.e. number of epochs, loss function and metrics to record. 
The code is currently hardcoded to use the "Adams" [optimizer](https://keras.io/optimizers/), 
this could be added to the config, but given the problem I don't think there is much reason 
for ever changing that. And if that's required it's a straightforward addition.
The current in use config will be added to git. 

The weights of the trained model are then saved in an .h5 file along with a .pickle file,
which stores the instance of [StandardScaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html)
used for the preprocessing of the data (done as part of the *train_model.py* script).
